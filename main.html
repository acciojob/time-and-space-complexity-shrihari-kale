  <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

  <!-- Paragraph 1: explains Time Complexity -->
  <p>
    Time complexity measures how the running time of an algorithm grows relative to the size of its input.
    It is expressed using big-O notation (for example <code>O(1)</code>, <code>O(n)</code>, <code>O(n log n)</code>) to capture the dominant cost as input scales.
    When designing algorithms we often aim for solutions that are more <strong>efficient</strong> in time so they complete faster on large inputs.

  <!-- Paragraph 2: explains Space Complexity with bold text within -->
  <p>
    Space complexity describes the amount of memory an algorithm requires as a function of input size.
    <b>Space Complexity</b> accounts for temporary structures, recursion stacks, and any extra storage beyond the input itself.
    For example, an algorithm that needs an extra array proportional to the input has space complexity <code>O(n)</code>, while an in-place algorithm that only uses a few variables is <code>O(1)</code>.
